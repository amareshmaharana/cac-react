# Context API in React

-> Explore about **useContext**, **createContext**, also  **Context Provider**
- Here 2 projects are available which i did in time of studying context api.
- #1 project is : **miniContext** which was just a small project
- #2 project is : **themeSwitcher** it was also a small project but here toggling the dark or light mode was worked.
